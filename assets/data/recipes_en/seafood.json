    "ingredients": [
      "1 lb Large shrimp (peeled and deveined)",
      "1 can Lemon-lime soda (about 330ml, for marinating)",
      "4 tbsp Butter",
      "3–4 cloves Garlic, minced",
      "Salt, to taste",
      "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste",
      "1–2 tsp Italian seasoning",
      "1–2 tbsp Lemon juice",
      "2 tbsp Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Prepare the shrimp: Rinse the shrimp under cold water, peel if needed, and devein by cutting along the back and removing the dark vein. Pat dry with paper towels. Place the shrimp in a bowl and pour in enough lemon-lime soda to cover them. Let marinate for about 10 minutes to help tenderise the shrimp and reduce any fishy smell. Drain the soda and pat the shrimp dry again before cooking.",
      "Start the pan: Place a large skillet over medium heat and add the 4 tbsp butter. Once the butter has melted and starts to foam, add the minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant and just turning lightly golden. Take care not to burn the garlic.",
      "Cook the shrimp: Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the shrimp to the pan in a single layer so they sear nicely. Cook for about 1–2 minutes on the first side until the shrimp begin to turn pink and opaque, then flip and cook another 1–2 minutes on the other side. Do not overcook or the shrimp will become tough.",
      "Season: When the shrimp are almost cooked through, sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and Italian seasoning. Add 1–2 tbsp lemon juice and toss everything together in the pan for another 30 seconds so the shrimp are coated in the garlicky butter sauce and the flavours meld.",
      "Finish and serve: Remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle the shrimp with chopped fresh parsley and toss gently. Transfer the shrimp and all the buttery pan juices to a serving dish. Serve hot with crusty bread, steamed rice, or pasta."

    "total_time": "19–20 mins",
    "image": "assets/images/categories/seafood/grilled_salmon_steak.jpg",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 Salmon steaks (about 2–3cm thick)",
      "Sea salt",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "1–2 tbsp Olive oil (for brushing the fish and grill pan/grill grates)",
      "2 tbsp Butter or Ghee (optional, for basting)",
      "1–2 Lemons, cut into wedges (for serving)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Season the salmon: Pat the salmon steaks dry on both sides with paper towels. Brush lightly with olive oil and season generously with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides. Let the salmon sit at room temperature for about 10–15 minutes while you heat the grill or pan.",
      "Heat the grill or pan: Place a grill pan or preheat your grill over medium-high heat. Brush the grill grates or pan with a little olive oil to prevent sticking. Allow it to heat until very hot and just starting to smoke lightly (about 3–5 minutes).",
      "Cook the first side: Place the salmon steaks on the hot grill or pan. Press down gently with a spatula to ensure good contact with the surface. Grill for about 4–5 minutes without moving them, until grill marks form and the salmon is cooked about halfway up the side.",
      "Flip and baste: Carefully flip the salmon and cook the second side for another 4–5 minutes for medium to medium-rare doneness. If using butter or ghee, add it to the pan and, once melted, spoon the hot melted fat over the tops of the steaks to baste and add richness.",
      "Check doneness: The salmon should be just opaque in the centre and still moist. For more precision, use an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part (about 50–55°C / 122–131°F for a moist centre). Cook a little longer if you prefer it more well done.",
      "Rest and serve: Transfer the salmon steaks to a plate and let rest for 2–3 minutes so the juices redistribute. Serve immediately with lemon wedges for squeezing over the fish, along with grilled vegetables, mashed potatoes, or salad."

      "1–2 tbsp Lemon juice",
      "2–3 tbsp Chopped coriander (cilantro)",
      "1–2 Jalapeño or Serrano peppers, finely chopped (adjust to taste)",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Cook the vegetables: Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Add the diced carrots and peas and cook for 3–5 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still slightly firm. Drain and rinse briefly under cold water to stop the cooking. Let them drain and cool completely.",
      "Prepare the tuna: Open the cans of tuna and drain off as much oil as possible. Place the tuna in a mixing bowl and use a fork to break it up into small chunks (but not completely mashed).",
      "Make the spicy dressing: In a separate bowl, combine the mayonnaise (1/3–1/2 cup), lemon juice (1–2 tbsp), chopped coriander, and finely chopped jalapeño or Serrano peppers. Whisk until smooth. Taste and adjust the level of heat and acidity by adding more chili or lemon juice if desired.",
      "Combine the salad: Add the tuna to the spicy mayonnaise mixture and fold gently until the tuna is evenly coated. Then add the cooled carrots and peas and fold again to distribute the vegetables throughout the salad.",
      "Season and serve: Taste the salad and season with salt and black pepper as needed. If the salad is too thick, add a little more mayonnaise or a splash of lemon juice. Serve chilled or at room temperature on a bed of lettuce, as a sandwich filling, or with crackers."

    "total_time": "30 mins",
    "image": "assets/images/categories/seafood/fried_calamari.jpg",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into rings",
      "1–1.5 cups Milk (for soaking)",
      "1 cup All-purpose flour",
      "1/2 cup Cornstarch",
      "1 tsp Baking powder",
      "1 tsp Dried oregano",
      "1/2–1 tsp Cayenne pepper (to taste)",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "Oil for deep frying (enough to submerge the squid)",
      "Lemon wedges (for serving)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Prepare the squid: Clean the squid thoroughly, removing the inner cartilage and membrane. Slice the bodies into rings about 1cm thick. Place the squid rings in a bowl and cover with milk. Soak for about 30 minutes to help tenderise the squid and reduce any fishy odour. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels.",
      "Make the coating: In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour (1 cup), cornstarch (1/2 cup), baking powder (1 tsp), dried oregano (1 tsp), cayenne pepper (1/2–1 tsp), salt (about 1/2–1 tsp), and a little black pepper. Whisk to blend all the dry ingredients evenly.",
      "Heat the oil: Pour enough oil into a deep pot or deep frying pan to cover the squid. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 175–185°C (350–365°F). If you don’t have a thermometer, test by dropping in a pinch of the flour mixture; it should sizzle and rise to the surface quickly.",
      "Coat and fry: Toss the drained squid rings in the flour mixture, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated. Shake off any excess flour. Working in small batches so as not to overcrowd the pot, gently lower the coated squid into the hot oil. Fry for about 1–2 minutes until the coating is puffed, crisp, and golden.",
      "Drain and serve: Use a slotted spoon to lift the fried calamari out of the oil. Drain on a wire rack set over paper towels. While still hot, sprinkle with a little extra salt. Serve immediately with lemon wedges for squeezing and your favourite dipping sauce, such as garlic mayonnaise or aioli."

      "2 lbs Mussels",
      "3–4 tbsp Butter",
      "2 Small shallots, finely chopped",
      "3–4 cloves Garlic, minced",
      "1 cup Chicken stock",
      "1 cup Dry white wine",
      "1/2 cup Cream (optional)",
      "2–3 tbsp Fresh parsley, chopped",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "Crusty bread, for serving"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Clean the mussels: Rinse the mussels under cold running water. Scrub the shells to remove any dirt and pull off the beards (the fibrous threads) from the shell. Discard any mussels with cracked shells or those that are open and do not close when tapped firmly.",
      "Sauté aromatics: In a large, heavy pot, melt 2–3 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add the finely chopped shallots and sauté for 3–4 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more, stirring, until fragrant but not browned.",
      "Add wine and stock: Pour in the white wine (1 cup) and chicken stock (1 cup). Stir and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat slightly to maintain a gentle boil. Season lightly with salt and black pepper (go easy on the salt as the mussels will add their own salinity).",
      "Steam the mussels: Add the cleaned mussels to the pot and immediately cover with a tight-fitting lid. Cook over medium-high heat for 6–10 minutes, shaking the pot once or twice during cooking so the mussels cook evenly. The mussels are done when their shells have opened.",
      "Make the cream sauce (optional): Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked mussels to a large serving bowl, discarding any that have not opened. Reduce the heat to low. Stir the remaining butter and the cream (1/2 cup, if using) into the cooking liquid. Simmer gently for 2–3 minutes until slightly thickened. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.",
      "Finish and serve: Stir the chopped parsley into the sauce, then pour the hot white wine/cream sauce over the mussels in the serving bowl. Serve immediately with plenty of crusty bread for dipping into the sauce."
